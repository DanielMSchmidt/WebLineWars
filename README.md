WebLineWars
============

We want to build a Hero Line Wars Version, which runs in the browser (responsive would be nice). It will be possible to play with others via webrtc.

Getting Started
----------------

Just run ```grunt build``` to get a ready to run version in the dist directory. Copy it to your webserver and be happy!

Development
------------

1. Make sure [node](http://nodejs.org/) is installed (at least version 0.4.0)
2. Install Grunt globally with ```npm install -g grunt-cli```
3. Run ```npm install``
4. Start your development server with ```grunt server```


Todo
------

- Add Gruntfile
- Build a small demo game
